import psycopg2

'''
Based on the Phi Operator structure, construct standard SQL queries to be sent to the Postgres database.
The result of the queries should be combined to create the result of the full ESQL query.

These functions are to be exported to the main file to be used there, so here we will assume that we have the connection to the database
and will be passed to the functions as a parameter.
